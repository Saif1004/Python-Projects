## 0. Practicals and Exercises

I have done various practicals up to and including week 5 to demonstrate my ability in that specific area. For most
weeks I have done 2 programs in order to broaden my range of expertise and programming. I have done 2 weather programs 
which are quite different as the first one is with a for loop whereas the second one is with a while loop and a function
which shows my gradual increase in skill. Also, I completed an exam marks program which lists grades and marks for the 
user and a number guessing game as well with the use of a basic function. My week 2 consists of simple input output with
if statements.

## 1. Task 1: Pizza Prices

My pizza program is complete and runs as expected. All it requires is user input, and it can handle erroneous input well
. It can run via gitbash or the normal python run console


## 2. Task 2: The Cat Shelter

The program runs correctly and the file name should be taken as a command line argument as in tests it ran on command
line, gitbash, and terminal. The program will not run on the normal python console but works perfectly fine as a command
line argument.

## 3. Task 3: Managing Passwords

The program as a whole seems to work correctly though there are small underlying errors which are, deleting the user
will delete all users, login seems to work on only one user which is the first one. Program only runs on gitbash or the
command line.
